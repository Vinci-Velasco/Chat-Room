# Chat-Room
A command line chat room where 2 users can connect to each other and send messages!

How to run after cloning the repo:
  1. Type 'make' into the command line where the folder is stored
  2. Type './lets-talk (local port) (remote host) (remote port)' into the command line where (local port) = port you are using, (remote host) being the ip address of the other user, and (remote port) being their port you want to connect to. Ex: './lets-talk 3000 192.168.0.513 3001'
  3. Do the same steps above for the other user (making sure their local port matches with the remote port of the previous step)
  4. You can now talk to each other!
